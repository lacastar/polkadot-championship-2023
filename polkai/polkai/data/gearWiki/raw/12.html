Substrate provides extensive functionality out-of-the-box and allows developers to focus on creating a custom engine on top of the protocol. This covers the most desired requirements for enterprise-ready decentralized projects.\n\nIt is an important component of the Polkadot network and it allows every team creating a new blockchain not to waste efforts for implementing the code for networking, consensus and other essential components from scratch. Refer to the Substrate Documentation for more details.\n\nPolkadot is a next-generation Layer-0 blockchain protocol intended to unite multiple purpose-built blockchains, allowing them to operate seamlessly together at scale. The critical aspect of the Polkadot network is its ability to route arbitrary messages between chains. These messages enable negotiation channels between two parachains and allow sending asynchronous messages through it.\n\nIt's easy to understand the functions of Substrate by its name. The main Substrate features are the following:\n\nSubstrate enables the Gear team to significantly reduce development time and focus on developing the main Gear Protocol components. Rust guarantees security and high performance.\n\nGear's unique asynchronous messaging architecture enables efficient communication between networks built on Substrate technology. This seamless integration contributes to interoperability for improved network functionality and participation.\n\nBut even with Substrate, launching a new blockchain remains relatively expensive and time consuming. But the Gear Protocol allows dApp developers to focus on their projects rather than building and operating an entirely new blockchain from scratch."}
