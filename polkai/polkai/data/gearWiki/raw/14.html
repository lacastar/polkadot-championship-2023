This includes the various block production metrics as well as node uptime which is vital in PoS networks.\n\nAs any other Substrate based nodes, Gear node can be connected to an arbitrary telemetry backend using the --telemetry-url.\n\nTo start sending telemetry messages to the arbitrary telemetry server instance, one needs to specify an additional key during node run that will enable sending telemetry to specified http address.\n\nIf you want to participate and share your telemetry, run your node with the flag (we assume the executable is in /usr/bin directory):\n\nAlso, you can provide your node name using the --name flag:\n\nFor example, to start a node with telemetry, run the command:\n\nYou can send more information (e.g., the validator address) by increasing the verbosity level:\n\nTo check telemetry for currently running nodes, visit the web address: https://telemetry.rs.\n\nYou can find some additional information about monitoring in the Substrate docs."}
