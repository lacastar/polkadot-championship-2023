Some useful code snippets are provided in the Cookbook section.\n\nThe basic API is implemented on the Substrate layer and is the same for all Substrate-based networks. The Gear-JS API code is available on GitHub. Complete API overview can be found on the Polkadot documentation portal.\n\nStart the API connection to the local running RPC node:\n\nYou can also connect to a different node:\n\nThis simple example describes how to subscribe to a new blocks and get chain spec:\n\nAlso, refer to the article that demonstrates the creation of a React application that connects to an NFT smart contract running on the blockchain."}
