Where:\n\n* salt: Bytes - the random data that is added to the hashing process to force their uniqueness\n\n* initPayload: Bytes- the init message payload that will be processed by the init() function during program initialization\n\n* gasLimit: u64 - the amount of gas that users are willing to spend on processing the upload of a new program\n\n* value: u128 - the value that will be transferred to a balance of the newly created account for the program\n\nNote: while extrinsics represent information from the outside world, events represent information from the chain. Extrinsics can trigger events.\n\nThe extrinsic that was called to upload a program triggers a series of events. Learn more about events here.\n\nThere are several ways to upload a program:\n\nThe easiest way to upload the program is to use the “Upload program” option in the Gear Idea portal - idea.gear-tech.io.\n\nThe Gear-js library provides a simple and intuitive way to connect Gear Component APIs, including interaction with programs. More details: Gear API.\n\ngear-program is the command line (CLI) utility for interacting with the blockchain network. Refer to gear-program GitHub repo for details."}
