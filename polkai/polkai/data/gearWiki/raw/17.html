This gas is paid for by the initiator of these actions.\n\nThey guarantee successful message processing and to avoid errors like Gaslimit exceeded, you can simulate the execution in advance to calculate the exact amount of gas that will be consumed.\n\nTo find out the minimum gas amount required to send extrinsic, use api.program.calculateGas.[method]. Depending on the conditions, you can calculate gas for initializing a program or processing a message in handle() or reply()."}
