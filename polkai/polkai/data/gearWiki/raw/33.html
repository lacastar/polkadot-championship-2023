Users can upload smart-contracts and interact with them through transactions in blockchain networks built on top of Gear Protocol. To make this happen, users need to connect a Substrate account. Gear Idea portal can work with Substrate accounts in any connected Gear-powered networks. Moreover this account can be used for holding funds and making transactions in any network of the Dotsama ecosystem and even more.\n\nThere are several ways to create a Substrate account, depending on whether you are using a desktop or a mobile device.\n\nThere are two main features that make up an account - an address and a key:\n\n* An address is the public aspect of the account. This is essentially a location that can be shared with others in order to send transactions to and from.\n\n* A key is the private part of the account. This is what enables you as an account owner to access the address. The only way to access your account is via your private key (using the mnemonic phrase, seed, or your account's JSON file and a password).\n\nTalisman is a popular and user-friendly wallet for creating and managing Substrate accounts. Being connected to web3 applications across various networks, Talisman browser extension allows to store, send and receive assets.\n\nOpen the extension by clicking on the logo in the menu bar.\n\nAnd that's it. Your wallet has been created:\n\nSubwallet is another advanced wallet for managing Substrate as well as EVM accounts.\n\nOpen Subwallet by clicking on its logo in the browser menu bar.\n\nSelect the type of account you want to create (Subwallet allows you to create Substrate-like and Ethereum accounts at once). Copy your seed phrase and keep it in the same place:\n\nProvide your password in the next step. And click \"Add the account with the generated seed\"\n\nCongratulations, your wallet has been successfully created!\n\nThe polkadot.js browser extension is the original application created by Parity Technologies for managing Substate accounts. This method involves installing the polkadot.js plugin and using it as a \"virtual vault\" that's separate from your browser to store your private keys and sign transactions.\n\nYou can install the extension via the following links.\n\nOpen the extension by clicking on the logo in the menu bar\n\nClick the large plus button to create a new account. Alternatively, you can navigate to the smaller plus icon in the top right and select \"Create New Account\".\n\nSave the seed phrase in a safe place using the security advices at the beginning of this article.\n\nSpecify the name of your account and a strong password for making transactions. Click \"Add the account with the generated seed\".\n\nYou've now successfully created a new account using the polkadot.js browser extension.\n\nIf you need access to your accounts on a mobile device, then you can use the following mobile wallets for the Polkadot/Kusama ecosystem:\n\nAll supported wallets you can check here.\n\nIf you have Gear node installed, you can generate a new seed phrase using the command:\n\nAnd then import the generated seed phrase into any convenient wallet.\n\nYes, you can access your account on a different device or wallet of your choice as long as you have the account's seed phrase or JSON file associated with the account.\n\nThere isn't functionality to make transactions directly in the polkadot.js browser extension. To make transactions, you need to launch Gear Idea on your browser. Before you can make any transactions, you have to allow Gear Idea to access your account. The browser extension is what holds your account information. You choose which websites get to access this information."}
