The user replies using gear.sendReply extrinsic. The program uses the msg::reply or msg::reply_with_gas function.\n\nSometimes, it is more convenient to provide gas for the reply handling in advance. For example, if the program sends a message to another program and waits for a reply, it can provide gas for the reply handling in advance. In this case, the program doesn't need to provide gas for the reply handling when it sends a reply.\n\nTo provide gas for the reply handling in advance, the program should use the exec::reply_deposit function:\n\nThe program can deposit gas when using the msg::send_for_reply function by setting the reply_deposit parameter. The reply_deposit parameter is the amount of gas that will be reserved for the reply handling. The reply_deposit parameter is optional. If the reply_deposit parameter is zero, the program should provide gas for the reply handling when it sends a reply."}
