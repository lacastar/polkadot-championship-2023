For nodes in a production network, the hardware requirements will be provided further.\n\nPlease refer to the System Requirements to see the actual hardware requirements.\n\nPlease refer to the Troubleshooting section to find typical errors and solutions.\n\nRunning a node in a production network will be incentivized. There are no regular rewards for running nodes in a test net, but participation in community events is also incentivized. Stay tuned.\n\nNot at the moment. Stay tuned.\n\nThat's all at the moment, but stay tuned for future updates.\n\nThe solution is to configure the Gear node as a service.\n\nThis should be resolved by adding --no-private-ipv4 argument when running the node. If for some reason, that argument doesn't solve the issue for you, then you can deny egress traffic to:\n\nFor example you can use this manual: https://community.hetzner.com/tutorials/block-outgoing-traffic-to-private-networks\n\nYou just need to replace the node executable (gear) with the latest version and restart the execution. For example, if your Linux executable is located at /usr/bin you are to run:\n\nUpdate the node binary to the latest version.\n\nUse one of the supported flags when running the node:\n\nSee the Checking logs section for details.\n\nThe full node syncing time may be calculated using the info from the log:\n\nFor example, let's calculate the syncing time from the following log record:\n\nYes, it is visible on the telemetry portal - https://telemetry.rs. It will be gray until the block height becomes up to date.\n\nNo, not at the moment.\n\nThere is no such command."}
