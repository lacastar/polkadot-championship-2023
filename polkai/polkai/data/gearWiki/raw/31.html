But being a model of the blockchain network, gtest cannot be a complete reflection of the latter.\n\nAs we said earlier, gtest is excellent for unit and integration testing. It is also helpful for debugging Gear program logic. Nothing other than the Rust compiler is required for running tests based on gtest. It is predictable and robust when used in continuous integration.\n\nTo use the gtest library, you must import it into your Cargo.toml file in the [dev-dependencies] block to fetch and compile it for tests only:\n\n* Initialization of the common environment for running smart contracts:\n\n* Getting the program from the system:\n\n* Processing the result of the program execution:"}
