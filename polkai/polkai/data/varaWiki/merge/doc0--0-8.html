Join Vara online hackathon -  Gear up\n\nVara empowers its community to decide the evolution of the network through its on-chain governance mechanism. In the interests of decentralization, longevity and flexibility, Vara leverages the widely-adopted OpenGov framework as its native governance model. This allows any VARA token holder to participate in Vara’s decentralized governance to help determine any future updates or modifications to the network.\n\nThe goal is to ensure that Vara Network stakeholders are represented, led, and engaged in decision-making processes to collaboratively decide the direction of the network. To accomplish this, Vara establishes a clear mandate and set of values to ensure orderly discussion and execution of decisions. At its most fundamental level, Vara’s governance model ensures that stakeholders controlling at least 50% of all funds staked to the network are able to direct its future — assuming they have enough conviction in their position.\n\nConviction - The amount of “weight” a vote carries. This is calculated using the number of tokens locked into a vote, plus the user-defined period of time tokens should be locked for. The longer this lock-in period, the greater conviction a vote will carry.\n\nProposal - an action or item proposed by a token holder, which is open for voting and discussion by all token holders. This is tied to a specific change to the Vara network, including values for key parameters, code upgrades, or changes to the governance system itself.\n\nReferendum (plural: referenda) -  a proposal that has met the proposal criteria and entered from the Lead-In period to the Deciding Period. It remains open for token-holder voting for the defined time, before being checked against referendum criteria and entering the Enactment period if successful.\n\nOrigin - a set of permissions that define the source for an operation, which is used to determine the Track that a referendum is posted under.\n\nTrack - an Origin-specific pipeline that outlines the life cycle of proposals. Currently, there are several Tracks available, including Root, Whitelisted, General Admin, Emergency Canceller, and Emergency Killer.\n\nFellowship - a group of community members who have special voting rights within the Gear protocol and can add certain proposals to the Whitelisted Track.\n\nApproval - the minimum \"Aye\" votes as a percentage of overall Conviction-weighted votes needed for an approval.\n\nSupport - the minimum number of \"Aye\" votes, not taking into consideration Conviction-weighted votes, needed as a percent of the total supply needed for an approval.\n\nLead-in Period - the initial proposal voting and discussion period. At this stage, proposals are in an undecided state until they pass some criteria for the given Track, including the Track having capacity, a minimum Prepare Period having passed, and a decision deposit having been paid.\n\nDecision Deposit - the minimum deposit amount required for a referendum to progress to the Decision Period after the end of the Lead-in Period. Its goal is to mitigate spam since each Track has a predefined capacity for concurrent referenda.\n\nDeciding Period - token holders continue to vote on the referendum. If a referendum does not pass by the end of the period, it will be rejected, and the Decision Deposit will be refunded.\n\nEnactment Period - a specified time, which is defined at the time the proposal was created, that an approved referendum waits before it can be dispatched. There is a minimum amount of time for each Track.\n\nVara’s governance model is powered by a democratic model that factors in token holders’ votes, and gives them the ability to delegate voting power to community members in several ways. Proposals are submitted by the community, after which they will be discussed and voted upon by the community.\n\nReferenda can be proposed, discussed, and voted towards, using Vara’s governance forum: https://vara.polkassembly.io/gov-2\n\nReferenda are simple and inclusive. Stake-based voting schemes use votes from different organizations to make decisions in the shared ecosystem of a distributed ledger (i.e on-chain governance). Each referendum has a specific proposal that takes the form of a privileged function call, which can switch out the entire code of the runtime in the runtime, which would typically require a \"hard fork\" in legacy blockchain networks.\n\nReferenda can be initiated by following one of several ways. Publicly submitted proposals, proposals submitted by the fellowship, and proposals submitted as part of the enactment of a prior referendum. Referenda have a fixed time to lunch: 28 days. Proposals submitted as part of the enactment of a prior referendum can be set as desired.\n\nAll referenda have an enactment delay associated with them. This delay is the period between the referenda ending and — assuming the proposal was approved — being enacted.\n\nVara’s network members can start a referendum at any time. Referenda can be started as often as necessary and can last indefinitely. Several features, known as Origins and Tracks, help streamline the referenda flow.\n\nAn Origin can be thought of as a rich descriptor for a given privilege level. The proposer of the referenda now selects an appropriate Origin for their request based on the proposal's requirements. Each Origin is associated with a single referendum class, and each type is related to a Track.\n\nThe Track outlines the lifecycle of the proposal. It is independent of other proposal tracks, which allows the network to tailor the dynamics of referenda based on their implied privilege level. In the example, a runtime upgrade (set_code call) has different implications for the ecosystem than an approval of a treasury tip (reportAwesome call). Therefore different origins need to be established with separate predetermined turnouts, approvals, deposits, and minimum enactment periods.\n\nVara aims to keep barriers to entry low and allows anyone to start a referendum at any time. Anyone may also vote on these referenda, and there are no limits to the number of referenda that are open and able to be voted on at any one time.\n\nIn Gov2, the proposer is given the option to designate the specific Origin for their proposal's execution. Each Origin is linked to a distinct type of referendum class, with some classes having a single corresponding origin, while others consist of multiple Origins. Each class has its own Track, which serves as a pipeline for the proposal to progress through and is entirely separate from the tracks of other classes.\n\nProposals to be whitelisted by the Technical Committee before getting dispatched\n\nThe existence of distinct tracks enables proposers to customize the characteristics of their referenda according to their associated privilege levels. Referenda executed from more influential Origins will be subject to stricter safety measures, higher voting thresholds, and longer periods of consideration. The Root Origin is subject to the most stringent safeguards and highest thresholds. Origins that confer relatively limited power, such as the Tip Origin, which has the ability to spend a small amount of VARA tokens from the treasury, will have correspondingly shorter consideration periods and lower approval thresholds.\n\nUpon creation, a referendum becomes immediately votable by any member of the community. However, it does not enter a state in which it can be concluded, have its votes tallied, approved, and subsequently enacted. Before transitioning into the Deciding period, referenda must satisfy certain requirements. Until these conditions are met, they remain unresolved. There are three primary conditions that must be fulfilled.\n\nFirstly, all referenda have a lead-in period, which is a predetermined duration that must elapse following the proposal before the deciding period can commence. This period serves as an initial notice period, during which votes can be cast, thus mitigating the possibility of \"decision sniping.\" Such sniping could occur if an attacker with a significant proportion of voting power attempted to pass a proposal soon after its submission, thereby not allowing the broader voting population sufficient time to consider and vote.\n\nThe second requirement is the availability of space for the referendum within its track, as each track has a maximum limit on the number of referenda that can be in the Deciding period simultaneously. The number of proposals allowed on a track is dependent on the privileges of the associated Origin, with more influential Origins resulting in a lower limit. For instance, the Root-level Origin has a limit of one, indicating that only a single high-risk proposal can be in the Deciding state at any given time. On the other hand, the relatively weak Tipping track has less stringent limits since overpopulation of referenda is less of a threat, and it generally makes more sense to have more tips being decided over at any given time. When there is available space, the eligible referendum with the most votes in favor of approval from its class is elevated to the Deciding state.\n\nThe final requirement is the payment of a Decision Deposit, which serves to discourage frivolous proposals and prevent spamming or bloating of the system. Although the cost of creating a referendum is low and only covers the on-chain storage required to track it, having a referendum in the Deciding state poses greater risks and consumes limited system resources. To mitigate these risks and reserve space for more serious proposals, a larger deposit must be paid. By requiring a deposit, Vara aims to ensure that proposers carefully consider the potential impact of their proposals and contribute to a healthy decision-making environment.\n\nVoluntary Locking allows token holders to increase their voting power by declaring how long they are willing to lock up their tokens. The number of votes for each token holder will be determined by the following formula:\n\nThe conviction multiplier increases the vote by one every time the number of lock periods doubles.\n\nThe maximum number of \"doublings\" of the lock period is set to 6 (and thus 32 lock periods in total), and one lock period equals 7 days. Only doublings are allowed. You cannot lock for 24 periods and increase your conviction by 5.5.\n\nWhile a token is locked, you can still use it to vote and stake your tokens. You are only prevented from transferring these tokens to another account.\n\nVotes are always \"counted\" at the same time, which is at the end of the voting period. This is not impacted by the locking period of the tokens.\n\nToken holders can also delegate their voting power to another voter in the system. When votes are delegated in this way, the delegate votes with their own voting power, plus any delegated to them. This works with conviction voting, allowing VARA holders to lock up their tokens to increase your delegate's voting power on your behalf. Of course, the tokens in question never leave the delegator’s control, and they are free to switch delegates or regain direct control at any time.\n\nCurrent updates improve on this with a unique feature called Multirole Delegation. This allows you to specify a different delegate for every class of referendum in the system.\n\nReferenda are discrete events in the Vara Network with fixed voting periods. When the voting period ends, these votes are counted, tallied, and then chartered. These actions are separated from other init calls by using an identifier for each and can be executed if the vote is approved. With this binary nature comes simple voting options such as: aye (yes), nay (no), or abstaining entirely.\n\nWhen a proposal has been submitted, it will have a predetermined Lead-In Period, depending on its Track. At this stage, other token holders may vote towards it and lock up additional funds to demonstrate their conviction. Once this period has passed and the required criteria are met, the proposal progresses into the Deciding Period.\n\nThe Proposal/Referendum Process within The Vara Network\n\nOnce a proposal reaches the Deciding Period, it has the potential to be approved. However, this eligibility only lasts for 28 days, after which it will be rejected by default. To pass, a referendum must meet two criteria related to approval and support and must continue to meet these criteria for a specific Confirmation Period. Different referendum classes have varying Confirmation Period lengths, with more influential classes requiring a longer Confirmation Period. This serves as an additional safeguard against whale voters attempting to manipulate the voting process by placing a large enough vote to meet approval criteria unexpectedly.\n\nApproval is defined as the share of approval vote-weight (i.e. after adjustment for conviction) against the total number of vote-weight (for both approval and rejection). Support is the total number of votes in approval (i.e. ignoring any adjustment for conviction) compared to the total possible number of votes that could be made in the system. Each referendum class has different requirements for these values, and the requirements can reduce over time on a fixed schedule. This means that as voting progresses over the 28 days, the support and approval thresholds needed for a proposal to pass can decrease gradually. However, the thresholds will always start and end at similar levels, with at least 50% approval required.\n\nIf a proposal fails to get approved within 28 days, it is automatically rejected, and the Decision Deposit can be refunded. However, if the proposal successfully meets the passing criteria and continues to do so for the Confirmation Period, it is approved and enters the Enactment Period, where it is scheduled to execute from its proposed origin after an Enactment Delay.\n\nThe Enactment Delay, which is specified during proposal, has a minimum value based on the track. More powerful tracks require a longer Enactment Delay to give the network enough time to prepare for any potential changes introduced by the proposal.\n\nIn addition, there is a unique operation called Cancelation for intervening with a proposal already being voted on. The process will immediately reject an ongoing referendum regardless of its status. There is also a provision to ensure the deposit of the proposer is slashed if the proposal is malicious or spam.\n\nCancellation is a governance operation that must be voted upon by the network to be executed. The cancellation comes with its Origin and Track, which has a low lead-time and Approval/Support curves with slightly sharper reductions in their thresholds for passing, given that it is invoked with a sense of urgency.\n\nRoot-Origin proposals are necessary for system upgrades, fixes, and rescues, but they also have the potential to cause significant damage to the network and ecosystem. In Gov2, the approval and support required for early-passing are extremely high to ensure the safety of the system, and the lead-in and enactment periods are lengthy to provide adequate notice to all parties and prevent bad proposals from being approved. Although this process may be slow, it ensures maximum safety for everyone in the Vara network.\n\nHowever, there are times when it is crucial to implement a fix, upgrade, or rescue logic quickly. While there may be widespread agreement on the need for such action, the voting process's safeguards can make executing these changes challenging or impractical due to time constraints alone. In such cases, it can be helpful to oraclize expert opinions to make informed decisions and establish a clear, well-considered action plan on a tight timeline. Gov2 has a governing body called the \"Fellowship\" to oversee this process.\n\nThe Fellowship is a self-governing body with the primary goal of protecting the interests of the Vara community and network participants. A rank is associated with each member so that an organization can determine how well-informed it expects its opinions to be about technical matters and whether those opinions are grounded in sound reasoning and in line with Vara's interests.\n\nThe Fellowship is designed to have a broad membership with low barriers to entry. Becoming a candidate member of the Fellowship is as easy as placing a small deposit.\n\nMembers of the Fellowship can vote on any given proposal, and the Fellowship considers their collective opinion weighted by their rank.\n\nTo prevent a small group of participants from gaining effective control over the network, we adhere to three principles: firstly, the Fellowship must never have hard power over the network: it cannot change parameters, conduct rescues, or move assets. Concerning governance over the network, the only thing in its power is to reduce the effective timeline on which a referendum takes place.\n\nSecondly, the rank system and weights must be designed so that we would not expect small groups of individuals to be able to capture and control overall decision-making capacity. While the Fellowship weights those with higher rank more in the aggregate opinion, the weight should not be so high as to make a small number of higher members’ ideas impossible compared to a coherent thought from lower-ranked membership.\n\nThirdly, the Fellowship should be designed to grow and develop its membership and aggregate levels of expertise and ensure that its overall decision-making capacity strengthens over time.\n\nIn light of this, the Fellowship will have a constitution that describes in specific terms the requirements and expectations for individuals to attain and retain any given rank. Higher ranks can vote and promote lower ranks based on this constitution.\n\nTo support these conditions, the Fellowship will have a constitution that outlines the requirements and expectations for individuals to attain and retain any given rank. Higher ranks are able to vote and promote lower ranks based on this constitution.\n\nDemotion happens automatically after a period in which a member cannot defend their position to their peers. Suspension can happen only through a general referendum, ensuring that controversy or unpopularity within the Fellowship does not (necessarily) result in expulsion. To guard against the chance of the Fellowship becoming a cabal, entrance into the top-tier ranks also requires a full referendum. It cannot be bestowed merely by one's Fellowship peer.\n\nThe Whitelist pallet has a singular purpose: to allow one Origin to escalate the privilege level of another Origin for a particular operation.\n\nThe Fellowship authorizes an origin known as Whitelisted-Root to be executed with Root-level privileges and will only work with specific specified commands that the Fellowship has assigned. The Whitelist pallet verifies two things:\n\nThe origin is the Whitelisted-Root, i.e. that the referendum passed on this track\n\nThe Fellowship has indeed whitelisted the proposal.\n\nOnly if both conditions are satisfied the operation executes with Root-level privileges. This system enables the ability to have a new parallel Track (Whitelisted-Root Origin), whose parameters allow for a shorter voting turnaround.\n\nIn addition, a proposal may be blacklisted by Root origin. The blacklisted proposal and the associated referendum are immediately canceled. Also, the hash of this offer cannot reappear in the offer queue. The blacklist is useful in removing erroneous offers that may have been submitted with the same hash. How to Participate in Governance"}

There are several ways to generate a Substrate account described in this article, depending on whether you are using a desktop or a mobile device.\n\nThe Vara Network is Substrate-based, which means that any keypair compatible with the sr25519 will also work on Vara.\n\nFor most users, the use of popular and reliable wallets will be enough. If you need to create a cold wallet for storing funds, then you should pay attention to Polkadot Vault (previously Parity Signer). In the future we will also add Ledger support.\n\nThere are two key features that make up an account - an address and a key (keypair):\n\n* An address is the public aspect of the account. This is essentially a location that you can send transactions to and from.\n\n* A key is the private part of the account. This is what enables you to access the address.\n\nThe only way to access your account is via your private key (using the seed (or mnemonic) phrase or your account's JSON file and a password).\n\nYour seed phrase is the key to your account. If you lose access to your account, by changing the device, forgetting the password, or losing the JSON file, you can restore your account by using the seed. This also means that someone else can have access to your account if they also have access to your seed.\n\nWe recommend that you store your seed in secure places like encrypted hard drives, non-digital devices or ideally, paper. We also recommend that you take other safety precautions to prevent this copy from physical damage, for example fire and water, and make multiple copies stored in different locations.\n\nYou should never store your seed on a device that is, or ever will be, connected to the internet.\n\nYour account's JSON file is encrypted with a password. This means that while you can import into any wallet, you will need to use the password to do so successfully. As there is this additional layer of security - a password - you don't have to be as cautious about securing it. However, it's worth using highly secure passwords that are not used for anything else. It would be best if you made a note of this password offline.\n\nSubWallet is the comprehensive non-custodial wallet solution for Polkadot, Substrate & Ethereum ecosystems. With the mission of bringing users closer to Web3, SubWallet's vision is to become a Web3 multiverse gateway through which users can enjoy multichain services with utmost ease and absolute security.

Your wallet has been created:\n\nThe polkadot.js browser extension is the original application created by Parity Technologies for managing Substate accounts. This method involves installing the polkadot.js plugin and using it as a \"virtual vault\" that's separate from your browser to store your private keys and sign transactions.\n\nYou can install the extension via the following links.\n\nOpen the extension by clicking on the logo in the menu bar\n\nClick the large plus button to create a new account. Alternatively, you can navigate to the smaller plus icon in the top right and select \"Create New Account\".\n\nSave the seed phrase in a safe place using the security advices at the beginning of this article.\n\nSpecify the name of your account and a strong password for making transactions.

Each era has six epochs (or sessions). During the last epoch, the active set of the next era is elected. And after the end of each era, the rewards are calculated and are ready to be distributed to the validators and nominators.\n\nValidators are essential contributors to a successful blockchain network. When chosen to be part of a validator set, they help produce blocks and receive rewards for their investments in the platform.\n\nA validator node is required to be responsive, perform its expected duties in a timely manner, and avoid any slashable behavior.\n\nPlease follow this guide to get started: Run Vara Validator.\n\n* OS: Ubuntu 20.04 or later, Amazon Linux 2 or later\n\n* CPU: 4vCPUs @ 3.4GHz; (it coud be Intel Ice Lake, Xeon or Core series, even AMD Zen3)\n\n* Storage: minimum 160GB SSD storage. Should be increased as the blockchain grows.\n\nYou can find related information on our wiki page: Run Vara Validator > Hardware requirements\n\nNavigate to https://get.gear.rs/ and download the most recent stable release.\n\nYou can also get it from github release page: https://github.com/gear-tech/gear/releases/\n\nAll nodes must upgrade to the latest version within 12 hours of its release if it is labeled “critical” or “high” priority and 24 hours if it is labeled “medium” or “low” priority.\n\nYes, you can pull the latest image from GitHub Container Registry\n\nor find more tags here: https://github.com/gear-tech/gear/pkgs/container/node\n\nNavigate to https://polkadot.js.org/apps/?rpc=wss://rpc.vara-network.io#/staking, and you will find a list of the active validators\n\nSlashing is a mechanism to punish validators who act maliciously or negligently. If a validator tries to corrupt the network or is offline too often, a part of their staked fund (and those of their nominators) can be slashed.\n\nYour validator node can be slashed under the following scenarios:\n\nEquivocation: This occurs when a validator signs two or more blocks at the same height on the same chain. It's a serious offense because it can lead to the creation of two different versions of the blockchain, a situation known as a fork.\n\nUnresponsiveness: Validators are expected to be online and participate in the network consensus. If a validator is offline for an extended period and misses a certain number of votes, a portion of their stake can be slashed. This is generally considered a minor offense, and the slashing is less severe than for equivocation or producing invalid blocks.\n\nInvalid Block: Validators are expected to validate blocks correctly. If a validator produces a block that the network deems invalid, it can result in slashing. Note that it's unlikely to produce an invalid block unless you are running a modified node binary, therefore it's recommended to always download the binary from the official release page.\n\nIf a single validator is offline there’s no obvious reason to suspect malicious intent. The validator is not slashed, which means they also keep all their nominations. They are chilled. In practice, the protocol considers it problematic when 10% of the validator set is offline—that’s when slashing conditions kick in.\n\nThe penalty starts relatively small, 0.021% slashed if 10% are offline. But penalties increase linearly from there until the maximum penalty of 7% is hit when 44% of the network is offline.\n\nValidators may run their nodes on multiple machines to make sure they can still perform validation work in case one of their nodes goes down, but validator operators should be extremely careful in setting these up. If they do not have good coordination to manage signing machines, equivocation is possible, and equivocation offenses are slashed at much higher rates than equivalent offline offenses.\n\nGRANDPA equivocation has the harshest slashing penalty of all offenses, and it also exemplifies slashing based on the threat to the network—if 33% or more of the validator set commits a GRANDPA equivocation, the offenders lose 100% of their stake.\n\nIf you wish to remain a validator or nominator (e.g. you're only stopping for planned downtime or server maintenance), submitting the chill extrinsic in the staking pallet should suffice. It is only if you wish to unbond funds or reap an account that you should continue with the following.\n\nTo ensure a smooth stop to validation, make sure you should do the following actions:\n\nThese can all be done with PolkadotJS Apps interface or with extrinsics.\n\nFor each validator only the 256 biggest nominators can claim their reward. If you have more than 256 nominators, it is called oversubscription. Nominators should generally avoid nominating oversubscribed validators.\n\nYes, you can run multiple validators in Vara Network. Each validator will need its own separate stash and controller keys, as well as enough staked fund (either self-staked or nominated by others) to be in the active validator set.\n\nRunning multiple validators can increase your chances of earning rewards, but it also increases your responsibilities and potential risk of slashing. Remember, each validator node requires maintenance, a stable internet connection, and a secure setup to prevent downtime and malicious attacks.\n\nIt's important to note that running multiple validators doesn't mean running multiple nodes on the same server or under the same network conditions. This could lead to simultaneous failures, which could result in multiple nodes being slashed at the same time. Ideally, each validator node should be run on separate servers and potentially in different geographic locations for redundancy and resilience.\n\nTo maintain high availability for your validator node, it may seem tempting to use redundant validator setups. However, incorrect setups can be risky because validator session keys should be confined to one node. Duplication across nodes may cause equivocation slashes, leading to the loss of all staked funds.\n\nFortunately, a validator doesn't require constant uptime, as there's some tolerance within eras for offline periods and upgrades, and the slashing penalties due to downtime are much less severe than that caused by equivocation.\n\nTherefore, only attempt a high availability set-up when you know what you're doing.\n\n* Telemetry This tracks your node details including the version you are running, block height, CPU & memory usage, block propagation time, etc.\n\n* Prometheus-based monitoring stack, including Grafana for dashboards and log aggregation. It includes alerting, querying, visualization, and monitoring features and works for both cloud and on-premise systems.\n\nIdeally, a validator node should strive for 100% uptime to avoid any penalties and to perform its duties on the network effectively. In practice 99.5% uptime is considered safe, i.e. you should keep the daily average downtime within 15 minutes.\n\nNote that the actual amount of staked token (self-stake plus nominations) required to become a validator may be significantly higher due to competition from other validators.\n\nThe total amount of token that needs to be staked for a validator to be elected (self-stake plus nominations) is determined by the amount staked on other validators. If there are more validators who have a higher total stake, those validators will be chosen instead.\n\nYou can get the details by running the subquery/tutorials-validator-threshold indexer on Vara Network.\n\nStaking rewards are distributed at the end of each era, i.e., every 12 hours.\n\nRewards for validators and nominators are computed per era (an era is a period of 12 hours) based on era points. An era point is a reward point earned by a validator for performing certain actions such as producing a block.\n\nThe total reward pool for an era is split between validators (and their nominators) proportionally to the number of era points they have earned. The more era points a validator earns, the larger the portion of the reward pool they (and their nominators) receive.\n\nThe validator's own reward is then calculated based on their commission, which is a percentage of the total reward that they take before distributing the rest to their nominators. Nominators' rewards are distributed based on the amount of fund they have staked.\n\nThe commission is the percentage of rewards you keep before they are given out to nominators. With 0% commission, nominators get all the rewards; with 100% commission, they get NO rewards.\n\nIn general, in order to stay attractive to nominators you should keep the commission low. However, you also need to ensure that the commission rate you set allows you to sustainably operate your validator node. It's a balance of competitive positioning, sustainability, and profitability.\n\nThe ideal number of active validators is defined by the staking.validatorsCount storage item, and is subject to change in the future.\n\nYou can query the storage item by visiting PolkadotJS Apps > Developer > Chain state > staking > validatorCount\n\nIn each era, if there are more validators than the ideal threshold, the inactive validators will stay in the waiting list until they are elected.\n\nIt is recommended to have backups of the following files and directories in case your current node becomes inaccessible due to extreme conditions:\n\nValidator Session Keys: If you are running a validator node, please backup the secret seeds of your session keys for minimal downtime migration. These files are located in the ~/.local/share/gear/chains/vara_network/keystore directory. You must submit an extrinsic to replace the keys if they are leaked or lost.\n\nNetwork Key(optional): The network key uniquely identifies your node in the peer-to-peer network. It is located at ~/.local/share/gear/chains/vara_network/network/secret_ed25519. If this file is lost, a new peer identity will be randomly generated when the node starts.\n\nBlockchain Database(optional): The blockchain database resides in the ~/.local/share/gear/chains/vara_network/db directory. It can be deleted and synchronized from scratch at any time, but keep in mind that this process may take some time."}

Join Vara online hackathon -  Gear up\n\nThis article covers Vara Network's crypto-economics, highlighting key components, features, and the core utility of VARA. It also discusses measures taken to balance incentives and ensure ecosystem stability.\n\nThe vesting periods for the initial mint of VARA tokens are as follows:\n\nFounders/Team/Advisors - Fully locked for 12 months, then 36 months linear vesting (no lump-sum unlock).\n\nInvestors - Fully locked for 12 months, then 12 months linear vesting (no lump-sum unlock).\n\nVARA tokens maintain core utility features required for the network to operate: transaction fees, staking and network security, and governance.\n\nAll transfers of the gas token or interactions with smart contracts on the network require VARA, including developers deploying smart contracts. Developers can also pre-fund their smart contracts with gas for future execution using Gas Pools. This enables one of Vara Network’s exciting features — self-executing smart contracts.\n\nVARA tokens also play a crucial role in the consensus model of the Vara Network, where token holders help contribute to network security by staking their VARA tokens in exchange for a portion of the block reward.\n\nIncentives on the Vara Network have been carefully aligned to encourage the continued engagement of participants and support decentralization. Typically, most protocols award the entire network rewards (block rewards, tx fees, etc.) to the nodes who were selected to produce the latest block, with some protocols diverting a portion of these funds to a protocol treasury. This model is straightforward, reliable, and battle-tested. However, there is potential room to unlock additional token utility for growing decentralized ecosystems and create value for all stakeholders; Contributors to the Gear protocol are exploring the mechanics of how to distribute a portion of block rewards directly toward dApp developers in order to incentivize the creation of world-class dApps on the network. Subject to a governance decision, an automatic or semi-automatic rewards distribution program could be employed, where, for example, a part of block rewards and/or the tx fees go to the dApp developers, or optionally to stakers who support those dApps.\n\nWith this model, a portion of VARA block rewards and/or the transaction fees in each block or epoch would go directly to dApp developers. The size of this reward could be based on several possible on-chain and off-chain metrics, like transaction volume, user activity, total gas spend, and total value locked. These rewards could also be allocated to dApps to, for example, fund their own gas pool used to subsidize transaction fees for end-users. Rewarding developers is an important principle that may ultimately help build a stronger ecosystem for all participants — however, it is crucial that any new reward mechanism be thoroughly tested. Therefore, there are different implementations of automated developer reward systems (as well as mechanics of developer contribution validation ) that might be considered by contributors to the Vara Network for maximum security and efficiency. Final mechanics are subject to governance voting before being rolled out in several phases.\n\nAccording to initial research, by including developers and dApps within the network’s core incentive and rewards mechanisms, Vara Network could:\n\nEnable transparent rewards for developer's efforts in building and deploying dApps.\n\nProvide  additional funding for developers and an opportunity for projects to bootstrap their projects’ own continued development by increasing user activity, thereby including them into the value chain by default on a base layer level.\n\nSupport the flexibility for dApps to use the rewards however they see fit to benefit their users and ecosystem (For example, by using them for developer incentives, community airdrops, or staking these funds to help operate a dedicated node, etc.) This allows for new business models, as well as adding extra points of engagement for dApps and their target audience.\n\nCreate a value capture and distribution flywheel for VARA token consumption, and could also stimulate base protocol token accumulation within the hands of stakeholders who are inherently interested in base network development.\n\nCommunity members participating in the Vara Network will have the opportunity to vote on the exact implementation for developer incentives.\n\nExcessive inflation is one of the most criticized features of Layer 1/Layer 2 projects due to the impact it can have on financial sustainability and the community. Overly high inflation for a protocol’s token may cause:\n\nA concentration of token ownership, i.e. the accumulation of large shares of supply by team members and early investors by staking their locked allocations\n\nThese factors become even more critical when market conditions are subject to increased turbulence, thus less liquidity and demand.\n\nVara is designed such that protocol rewards would not affect network decentralization or concentration through periods of changes in liquidity. At the same time, the protocol must sufficiently reward stakers for contributing to network security. To achieve this, several mechanics were implemented to offset inflationary pressure and protect the development of the protocol and VARA token:\n\nThe maximum inflation rate for year 1 is 6.00%. VARA has been designed with a decreasing inflation rate in mind. Below is a sample inflation rate schedule, however, the exact rates will be determined by governance voting:\n\ngradual decrease to the minimum level of 3-4%\n\nLimit the amount of stakeable tokens to decrease the annual inflation rate.\n\nTeam and investor locked tokens are not stakeable until they are vested (this helps by reducing the potential inflation by more than 50% in the first 12 months and, more importantly, protecting against any increase in the centralization of token ownership)\n\nAn Inflation Offsetting Pool to reduce TTS Inflation to 0% for the first 24+ months. 10% of Total Token Supply (TTS) is allocated to a separate pool (the Inflation Offsetting Pool) to offset the increase of TTS caused by token emission from block rewards. Tokens from this pool are set to be automatically sent to a zero address (or “burned”) proportionally to the number of minted inflationary tokens. this will remain in effect unless otherwise allocated by the community for other funding initiatives (e.g. for developer grants/rewards pool), as voted upon and changed by the community.\n\nAbout ⅓  of the Foundation’s staking rewards will replenish the Inflation Offsetting Pool, with the remaining 2/3 going to fund Foundation operations and further protocol initiatives and development. Staking rewards received by Developer grants and Education/Bootcamp programs/PR/Events pools are going to fund the respective pools activities.\n\nProvide in-market staking incentives over time as the market continues to mature. The Vara Network maintains the Ideal Staking Rate by incentivizing or disincentivizing staking. Any downside divergence from the ideal staking rate will result in a higher ROI for stakers, providing a greater incentive to stake until the ideal stake rate has been achieved. Inversely, a staking rate higher than the ideal staking rate would yield a diluted return for stakers, encouraging token holders to unstake.\n\nThe Ideal Staking Rate on Vara is 85%. Based on preliminary research provided by community enthusiasts and observations of the other L1/L2 protocols, we expect the Ideal Staking Rate to decrease 75% within 12 months since the PoS launch (subject to governance voting)  before settling around 50-67%. This would allow the protocol to align the staking rate and inflation levels with the circulating supply growth.\n\nThese measures have the capacity to allow for maintenance of the same total token supply within the next 24+ months and, with the entire ecosystem in a more mature development stage, maintain an inflation rate in the low single-digits thereafter.\n\nTo encourage system flexibility, the community could choose to initiate a governance proposal to decide whether:\n\nThe Inflation Offsetting Pool allocation should be kept in full to continue offsetting TTS inflation,\n\nor 25-100% of this allocation should be moved to the developer grants pool\n\nIn addition, the DAO will also decide on switching to the treasury fueling model where up to 10% of the total block rewards go to the protocol treasury in order to fuel further protocol development.\n\nBased on early research, the ideal time to implement these changes would be roughly 12-24 months from genesis. The implementation will be determined by the community via governance vote.\n\nVara was designed with a decreasing annual inflation model in mind, instead of a flat predetermined inflation rate. This may be implemented by governance vote and aims to prevent an excess of tokens being minted that would be out of line with ecosystem growth, mitigating inflation and preventing token holders from becoming unnecessarily diluted.\n\nStaking ROI is driven by both the staking rate (the percentage of stakeable tokens staked) and the block rewards curve. The block rewards curve effectively represents the total protocol inflation with hardcoded Minimum Inflation (constant = 1%) and Maximum inflation. The Maximum Inflation level decreases (see above) as the Network and the Ecosystem mature.\n\nVara uses Polkadot’s standard inflation model to calculate the distribution of block rewards, with several key modifications:\n\nAt Genesis the stakeable tokens amount to 48.5% of TTS. This initially allows the protocol to have 51.5% less inflation while providing competitive market rates for staking ROI. While tokens are getting unlocked and/or expended, the number of stakeable tokens trends towards the TTS.\n\nThe proven and battle-tested block reward curve and ROI model implemented by Polkadot also supports the Vara network to incentivize token holders to maintain the Ideal Staking Rate.\n\nWithin the first 24 months, the Ideal Staking Rate will be decreased from 85% to 50-67% level (subject to governance voting as mentioned above), in line with token vesting unlocks and depending on the Foundation’s spending schedules/overall ecosystem development.\n\nEffective inflation of total token supply is a variable, not a constant, in the developed model. To calculate the total amount of tokens issued as block rewards, each block uses the block rewards curve instead of a fixed percentage. This is a divergence from Polkadot’s model, where a fixed inflation rate is minted before being divided between stakers and the Foundation treasury.\n\nInstead, the network mints only the number of tokens actually required to reward participation by validators in the network. In this model, Polkadot’s inflation model is used to determine the actual number of tokens minted, by aligning this with the Staking ratio. Another difference from the Polkadot model is the staking ROI cap: in case the staking ratio is significantly lower than the Ideal Staking Rate and ROI increases above a certain level, the surplus ROI surplus will be distributed to the treasury.\n\nThis enables Vara to issue only the amount of new tokens required to reward the percentage of stakeable tokens that were staked, so that the absolute inflation level is aligned with the participation of token holders staking to the network.\n\nTo form the Block rewards curve, the following rates are used:\n\nThe minimum inflation rate: constant  1% each year in case Staking rate = 0%\n\nThe maximum Inflation rate, which is constant for 12 months.\n\nThe max inflation rate will then be decreased as the network and the ecosystem mature (subject to governance vote as described above).\n\nFrom Minimum to Maximum inflation rates (i.e from 0% tokens staked to Ideal Staking Rate), the Block rewards curve grows gradually according to a linear equation (as in the standard Polkadot model).\n\nIn case the % of tokens staked > Ideal Staking Rate, the curve decreases to the Minimum inflation level according to a hyperbolic equation (as in the standard Polkadot model).\n\nThe staking ROI curve is driven by the block rewards curve and % of tokens staked: Block rewards curve / % of stakeable tokens staked. It decreases hyperbolically until the Ideal Staking Rate is reached and then falls hyperbolically in case % of the tokens staked increases beyond the Ideal Staking Rate.\n\nA maximum ROI of 30% has been implemented - if the staking rate falls below the Ideal Staking Rate, stakers receive a higher ROI than they would at the Ideal Staking Rate. Any staking rewards surplus on top of the 30% ROI cap goes to the Vara treasury."}

Join Vara online hackathon -  Gear up\n\nVara empowers its community to decide the evolution of the network through its on-chain governance mechanism. In the interests of decentralization, longevity and flexibility, Vara leverages the widely-adopted OpenGov framework as its native governance model. This allows any VARA token holder to participate in Vara’s decentralized governance to help determine any future updates or modifications to the network.\n\nThe goal is to ensure that Vara Network stakeholders are represented, led, and engaged in decision-making processes to collaboratively decide the direction of the network. To accomplish this, Vara establishes a clear mandate and set of values to ensure orderly discussion and execution of decisions. At its most fundamental level, Vara’s governance model ensures that stakeholders controlling at least 50% of all funds staked to the network are able to direct its future — assuming they have enough conviction in their position.\n\nConviction - The amount of “weight” a vote carries. This is calculated using the number of tokens locked into a vote, plus the user-defined period of time tokens should be locked for. The longer this lock-in period, the greater conviction a vote will carry.\n\nProposal - an action or item proposed by a token holder, which is open for voting and discussion by all token holders. This is tied to a specific change to the Vara network, including values for key parameters, code upgrades, or changes to the governance system itself.\n\nReferendum (plural: referenda) -  a proposal that has met the proposal criteria and entered from the Lead-In period to the Deciding Period. It remains open for token-holder voting for the defined time, before being checked against referendum criteria and entering the Enactment period if successful.\n\nOrigin - a set of permissions that define the source for an operation, which is used to determine the Track that a referendum is posted under.\n\nTrack - an Origin-specific pipeline that outlines the life cycle of proposals. Currently, there are several Tracks available, including Root, Whitelisted, General Admin, Emergency Canceller, and Emergency Killer.\n\nFellowship - a group of community members who have special voting rights within the Gear protocol and can add certain proposals to the Whitelisted Track.\n\nApproval - the minimum \"Aye\" votes as a percentage of overall Conviction-weighted votes needed for an approval.\n\nSupport - the minimum number of \"Aye\" votes, not taking into consideration Conviction-weighted votes, needed as a percent of the total supply needed for an approval.\n\nLead-in Period - the initial proposal voting and discussion period. At this stage, proposals are in an undecided state until they pass some criteria for the given Track, including the Track having capacity, a minimum Prepare Period having passed, and a decision deposit having been paid.\n\nDecision Deposit - the minimum deposit amount required for a referendum to progress to the Decision Period after the end of the Lead-in Period. Its goal is to mitigate spam since each Track has a predefined capacity for concurrent referenda.\n\nDeciding Period - token holders continue to vote on the referendum. If a referendum does not pass by the end of the period, it will be rejected, and the Decision Deposit will be refunded.\n\nEnactment Period - a specified time, which is defined at the time the proposal was created, that an approved referendum waits before it can be dispatched. There is a minimum amount of time for each Track.\n\nVara’s governance model is powered by a democratic model that factors in token holders’ votes, and gives them the ability to delegate voting power to community members in several ways. Proposals are submitted by the community, after which they will be discussed and voted upon by the community.\n\nReferenda can be proposed, discussed, and voted towards, using Vara’s governance forum: https://vara.polkassembly.io/gov-2\n\nReferenda are simple and inclusive. Stake-based voting schemes use votes from different organizations to make decisions in the shared ecosystem of a distributed ledger (i.e on-chain governance). Each referendum has a specific proposal that takes the form of a privileged function call, which can switch out the entire code of the runtime in the runtime, which would typically require a \"hard fork\" in legacy blockchain networks.\n\nReferenda can be initiated by following one of several ways. Publicly submitted proposals, proposals submitted by the fellowship, and proposals submitted as part of the enactment of a prior referendum. Referenda have a fixed time to lunch: 28 days. Proposals submitted as part of the enactment of a prior referendum can be set as desired.\n\nAll referenda have an enactment delay associated with them. This delay is the period between the referenda ending and — assuming the proposal was approved — being enacted.\n\nVara’s network members can start a referendum at any time. Referenda can be started as often as necessary and can last indefinitely. Several features, known as Origins and Tracks, help streamline the referenda flow.\n\nAn Origin can be thought of as a rich descriptor for a given privilege level. The proposer of the referenda now selects an appropriate Origin for their request based on the proposal's requirements. Each Origin is associated with a single referendum class, and each type is related to a Track.\n\nThe Track outlines the lifecycle of the proposal. It is independent of other proposal tracks, which allows the network to tailor the dynamics of referenda based on their implied privilege level. In the example, a runtime upgrade (set_code call) has different implications for the ecosystem than an approval of a treasury tip (reportAwesome call). Therefore different origins need to be established with separate predetermined turnouts, approvals, deposits, and minimum enactment periods.\n\nVara aims to keep barriers to entry low and allows anyone to start a referendum at any time. Anyone may also vote on these referenda, and there are no limits to the number of referenda that are open and able to be voted on at any one time.\n\nIn Gov2, the proposer is given the option to designate the specific Origin for their proposal's execution. Each Origin is linked to a distinct type of referendum class, with some classes having a single corresponding origin, while others consist of multiple Origins. Each class has its own Track, which serves as a pipeline for the proposal to progress through and is entirely separate from the tracks of other classes.\n\nProposals to be whitelisted by the Technical Committee before getting dispatched\n\nThe existence of distinct tracks enables proposers to customize the characteristics of their referenda according to their associated privilege levels. Referenda executed from more influential Origins will be subject to stricter safety measures, higher voting thresholds, and longer periods of consideration. The Root Origin is subject to the most stringent safeguards and highest thresholds. Origins that confer relatively limited power, such as the Tip Origin, which has the ability to spend a small amount of VARA tokens from the treasury, will have correspondingly shorter consideration periods and lower approval thresholds.\n\nUpon creation, a referendum becomes immediately votable by any member of the community. However, it does not enter a state in which it can be concluded, have its votes tallied, approved, and subsequently enacted. Before transitioning into the Deciding period, referenda must satisfy certain requirements. Until these conditions are met, they remain unresolved. There are three primary conditions that must be fulfilled.\n\nFirstly, all referenda have a lead-in period, which is a predetermined duration that must elapse following the proposal before the deciding period can commence. This period serves as an initial notice period, during which votes can be cast, thus mitigating the possibility of \"decision sniping.\" Such sniping could occur if an attacker with a significant proportion of voting power attempted to pass a proposal soon after its submission, thereby not allowing the broader voting population sufficient time to consider and vote.\n\nThe second requirement is the availability of space for the referendum within its track, as each track has a maximum limit on the number of referenda that can be in the Deciding period simultaneously. The number of proposals allowed on a track is dependent on the privileges of the associated Origin, with more influential Origins resulting in a lower limit. For instance, the Root-level Origin has a limit of one, indicating that only a single high-risk proposal can be in the Deciding state at any given time. On the other hand, the relatively weak Tipping track has less stringent limits since overpopulation of referenda is less of a threat, and it generally makes more sense to have more tips being decided over at any given time. When there is available space, the eligible referendum with the most votes in favor of approval from its class is elevated to the Deciding state.\n\nThe final requirement is the payment of a Decision Deposit, which serves to discourage frivolous proposals and prevent spamming or bloating of the system. Although the cost of creating a referendum is low and only covers the on-chain storage required to track it, having a referendum in the Deciding state poses greater risks and consumes limited system resources. To mitigate these risks and reserve space for more serious proposals, a larger deposit must be paid. By requiring a deposit, Vara aims to ensure that proposers carefully consider the potential impact of their proposals and contribute to a healthy decision-making environment.\n\nVoluntary Locking allows token holders to increase their voting power by declaring how long they are willing to lock up their tokens. The number of votes for each token holder will be determined by the following formula:\n\nThe conviction multiplier increases the vote by one every time the number of lock periods doubles.\n\nThe maximum number of \"doublings\" of the lock period is set to 6 (and thus 32 lock periods in total), and one lock period equals 7 days. Only doublings are allowed. You cannot lock for 24 periods and increase your conviction by 5.5.\n\nWhile a token is locked, you can still use it to vote and stake your tokens. You are only prevented from transferring these tokens to another account.\n\nVotes are always \"counted\" at the same time, which is at the end of the voting period. This is not impacted by the locking period of the tokens.\n\nToken holders can also delegate their voting power to another voter in the system. When votes are delegated in this way, the delegate votes with their own voting power, plus any delegated to them. This works with conviction voting, allowing VARA holders to lock up their tokens to increase your delegate's voting power on your behalf. Of course, the tokens in question never leave the delegator’s control, and they are free to switch delegates or regain direct control at any time.\n\nCurrent updates improve on this with a unique feature called Multirole Delegation. This allows you to specify a different delegate for every class of referendum in the system.\n\nReferenda are discrete events in the Vara Network with fixed voting periods. When the voting period ends, these votes are counted, tallied, and then chartered. These actions are separated from other init calls by using an identifier for each and can be executed if the vote is approved. With this binary nature comes simple voting options such as: aye (yes), nay (no), or abstaining entirely.\n\nWhen a proposal has been submitted, it will have a predetermined Lead-In Period, depending on its Track. At this stage, other token holders may vote towards it and lock up additional funds to demonstrate their conviction. Once this period has passed and the required criteria are met, the proposal progresses into the Deciding Period.\n\nThe Proposal/Referendum Process within The Vara Network\n\nOnce a proposal reaches the Deciding Period, it has the potential to be approved. However, this eligibility only lasts for 28 days, after which it will be rejected by default. To pass, a referendum must meet two criteria related to approval and support and must continue to meet these criteria for a specific Confirmation Period. Different referendum classes have varying Confirmation Period lengths, with more influential classes requiring a longer Confirmation Period. This serves as an additional safeguard against whale voters attempting to manipulate the voting process by placing a large enough vote to meet approval criteria unexpectedly.\n\nApproval is defined as the share of approval vote-weight (i.e. after adjustment for conviction) against the total number of vote-weight (for both approval and rejection). Support is the total number of votes in approval (i.e. ignoring any adjustment for conviction) compared to the total possible number of votes that could be made in the system. Each referendum class has different requirements for these values, and the requirements can reduce over time on a fixed schedule. This means that as voting progresses over the 28 days, the support and approval thresholds needed for a proposal to pass can decrease gradually. However, the thresholds will always start and end at similar levels, with at least 50% approval required.\n\nIf a proposal fails to get approved within 28 days, it is automatically rejected, and the Decision Deposit can be refunded. However, if the proposal successfully meets the passing criteria and continues to do so for the Confirmation Period, it is approved and enters the Enactment Period, where it is scheduled to execute from its proposed origin after an Enactment Delay.\n\nThe Enactment Delay, which is specified during proposal, has a minimum value based on the track. More powerful tracks require a longer Enactment Delay to give the network enough time to prepare for any potential changes introduced by the proposal.\n\nIn addition, there is a unique operation called Cancelation for intervening with a proposal already being voted on. The process will immediately reject an ongoing referendum regardless of its status. There is also a provision to ensure the deposit of the proposer is slashed if the proposal is malicious or spam.\n\nCancellation is a governance operation that must be voted upon by the network to be executed. The cancellation comes with its Origin and Track, which has a low lead-time and Approval/Support curves with slightly sharper reductions in their thresholds for passing, given that it is invoked with a sense of urgency.\n\nRoot-Origin proposals are necessary for system upgrades, fixes, and rescues, but they also have the potential to cause significant damage to the network and ecosystem. In Gov2, the approval and support required for early-passing are extremely high to ensure the safety of the system, and the lead-in and enactment periods are lengthy to provide adequate notice to all parties and prevent bad proposals from being approved. Although this process may be slow, it ensures maximum safety for everyone in the Vara network.\n\nHowever, there are times when it is crucial to implement a fix, upgrade, or rescue logic quickly. While there may be widespread agreement on the need for such action, the voting process's safeguards can make executing these changes challenging or impractical due to time constraints alone. In such cases, it can be helpful to oraclize expert opinions to make informed decisions and establish a clear, well-considered action plan on a tight timeline. Gov2 has a governing body called the \"Fellowship\" to oversee this process.\n\nThe Fellowship is a self-governing body with the primary goal of protecting the interests of the Vara community and network participants. A rank is associated with each member so that an organization can determine how well-informed it expects its opinions to be about technical matters and whether those opinions are grounded in sound reasoning and in line with Vara's interests.\n\nThe Fellowship is designed to have a broad membership with low barriers to entry. Becoming a candidate member of the Fellowship is as easy as placing a small deposit.\n\nMembers of the Fellowship can vote on any given proposal, and the Fellowship considers their collective opinion weighted by their rank.\n\nTo prevent a small group of participants from gaining effective control over the network, we adhere to three principles: firstly, the Fellowship must never have hard power over the network: it cannot change parameters, conduct rescues, or move assets. Concerning governance over the network, the only thing in its power is to reduce the effective timeline on which a referendum takes place.\n\nSecondly, the rank system and weights must be designed so that we would not expect small groups of individuals to be able to capture and control overall decision-making capacity. While the Fellowship weights those with higher rank more in the aggregate opinion, the weight should not be so high as to make a small number of higher members’ ideas impossible compared to a coherent thought from lower-ranked membership.\n\nThirdly, the Fellowship should be designed to grow and develop its membership and aggregate levels of expertise and ensure that its overall decision-making capacity strengthens over time.\n\nIn light of this, the Fellowship will have a constitution that describes in specific terms the requirements and expectations for individuals to attain and retain any given rank. Higher ranks can vote and promote lower ranks based on this constitution.\n\nTo support these conditions, the Fellowship will have a constitution that outlines the requirements and expectations for individuals to attain and retain any given rank. Higher ranks are able to vote and promote lower ranks based on this constitution.\n\nDemotion happens automatically after a period in which a member cannot defend their position to their peers. Suspension can happen only through a general referendum, ensuring that controversy or unpopularity within the Fellowship does not (necessarily) result in expulsion. To guard against the chance of the Fellowship becoming a cabal, entrance into the top-tier ranks also requires a full referendum. It cannot be bestowed merely by one's Fellowship peer.\n\nThe Whitelist pallet has a singular purpose: to allow one Origin to escalate the privilege level of another Origin for a particular operation.\n\nThe Fellowship authorizes an origin known as Whitelisted-Root to be executed with Root-level privileges and will only work with specific specified commands that the Fellowship has assigned. The Whitelist pallet verifies two things:\n\nThe origin is the Whitelisted-Root, i.e. that the referendum passed on this track\n\nThe Fellowship has indeed whitelisted the proposal.\n\nOnly if both conditions are satisfied the operation executes with Root-level privileges. This system enables the ability to have a new parallel Track (Whitelisted-Root Origin), whose parameters allow for a shorter voting turnaround.\n\nIn addition, a proposal may be blacklisted by Root origin. The blacklisted proposal and the associated referendum are immediately canceled. Also, the hash of this offer cannot reappear in the offer queue. The blacklist is useful in removing erroneous offers that may have been submitted with the same hash. How to Participate in Governance"}
