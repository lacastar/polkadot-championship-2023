There are several ways to generate a Substrate account described in this article, depending on whether you are using a desktop or a mobile device.\n\nThe Vara Network is Substrate-based, which means that any keypair compatible with the sr25519 will also work on Vara.\n\nFor most users, the use of popular and reliable wallets will be enough. If you need to create a cold wallet for storing funds, then you should pay attention to Polkadot Vault (previously Parity Signer). In the future we will also add Ledger support.\n\nThere are two key features that make up an account - an address and a key (keypair):\n\n* An address is the public aspect of the account. This is essentially a location that you can send transactions to and from.\n\n* A key is the private part of the account. This is what enables you to access the address.\n\nThe only way to access your account is via your private key (using the seed (or mnemonic) phrase or your account's JSON file and a password).\n\nYour seed phrase is the key to your account. If you lose access to your account, by changing the device, forgetting the password, or losing the JSON file, you can restore your account by using the seed. This also means that someone else can have access to your account if they also have access to your seed.\n\nWe recommend that you store your seed in secure places like encrypted hard drives, non-digital devices or ideally, paper. We also recommend that you take other safety precautions to prevent this copy from physical damage, for example fire and water, and make multiple copies stored in different locations.\n\nYou should never store your seed on a device that is, or ever will be, connected to the internet.\n\nYour account's JSON file is encrypted with a password. This means that while you can import into any wallet, you will need to use the password to do so successfully. As there is this additional layer of security - a password - you don't have to be as cautious about securing it. However, it's worth using highly secure passwords that are not used for anything else. It would be best if you made a note of this password offline.\n\nSubWallet is the comprehensive non-custodial wallet solution for Polkadot, Substrate & Ethereum ecosystems. With the mission of bringing users closer to Web3, SubWallet's vision is to become a Web3 multiverse gateway through which users can enjoy multichain services with utmost ease and absolute security. Connecting and using blockchain-based applications is smoother than ever with SubWallet Browser Extension & SubWallet Mobile App.\n\nOpen SubWallet by clicking on the logo in the browser menu bar.\n\nKeep your seed phrase in a safe place and never disclose it to anyone. After you have saved it, click I have kept it somewhere safe to move on.\n\nCongratulations, your wallet has been successfully created!\n\nTalisman is a popular non-custodial wallet for creating and managing Substrate accounts. Being connected to Web3 applications across various networks, Talisman browser extension allows to store, send and receive assets. The Talisman browser extension is one of the easiest and secure ways of creating a Substrate account.\n\nOpen the extension by clicking on the logo in the menu bar.\n\nAnd that's it. Your wallet has been created:\n\nThe polkadot.js browser extension is the original application created by Parity Technologies for managing Substate accounts. This method involves installing the polkadot.js plugin and using it as a \"virtual vault\" that's separate from your browser to store your private keys and sign transactions.\n\nYou can install the extension via the following links.\n\nOpen the extension by clicking on the logo in the menu bar\n\nClick the large plus button to create a new account. Alternatively, you can navigate to the smaller plus icon in the top right and select \"Create New Account\".\n\nSave the seed phrase in a safe place using the security advices at the beginning of this article.\n\nSpecify the name of your account and a strong password for making transactions. Click \"Add the account with the generated seed\".\n\nYou've now successfully created a new account using the polkadot.js browser extension.\n\nIf you need access to your accounts on a mobile device, then you can use the following mobile wallets for the Polkadot/Kusama ecosystem:\n\nAll supported wallets you can check here.\n\nIf you have Gear or Vara node installed, you can generate a new seed phrase using the command:\n\nAnd then import the generated seed phrase into any convenient wallet.\n\n* To see your account in the Vara Network format, just go to https://polkadot.js.org/apps/?rpc=wss%3A%2F%2Frpc.vara-network.io#/accounts.\n\n* The address will be shown in the Vara format (with kG… or kD… prefix). Copy the address if you want to share it with someone.\n\nYes, you can access your account on a different device or wallet of your choice as long as you have the account's seed phrase or JSON file associated with the account.\n\nThere isn't functionality to make transactions directly in the polkadot.js browser extension. To make transactions, you need to launch Gear Idea on your browser. Before you can make any transactions, you have to allow Gear Idea to access your account. The browser extension is what holds your account information. You choose which websites get to access this information.\n\nYes! At the moment Vara supports Parity Signer. Also in the future we will support Ledger.\n\nThe Vara address prefix is 137. To see your account in the Vara Network format, just go to https://polkadot.js.org/apps/?rpc=wss%3A%2F%2Frpc.vara-network.io#/accounts"}
