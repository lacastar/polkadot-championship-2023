Each era has six epochs (or sessions). During the last epoch, the active set of the next era is elected. And after the end of each era, the rewards are calculated and are ready to be distributed to the validators and nominators.\n\nValidators are essential contributors to a successful blockchain network. When chosen to be part of a validator set, they help produce blocks and receive rewards for their investments in the platform.\n\nA validator node is required to be responsive, perform its expected duties in a timely manner, and avoid any slashable behavior.\n\nPlease follow this guide to get started: Run Vara Validator.\n\n* OS: Ubuntu 20.04 or later, Amazon Linux 2 or later\n\n* CPU: 4vCPUs @ 3.4GHz; (it coud be Intel Ice Lake, Xeon or Core series, even AMD Zen3)\n\n* Storage: minimum 160GB SSD storage. Should be increased as the blockchain grows.\n\nYou can find related information on our wiki page: Run Vara Validator > Hardware requirements\n\nNavigate to https://get.gear.rs/ and download the most recent stable release.\n\nYou can also get it from github release page: https://github.com/gear-tech/gear/releases/\n\nAll nodes must upgrade to the latest version within 12 hours of its release if it is labeled “critical” or “high” priority and 24 hours if it is labeled “medium” or “low” priority.\n\nYes, you can pull the latest image from GitHub Container Registry\n\nor find more tags here: https://github.com/gear-tech/gear/pkgs/container/node\n\nNavigate to https://polkadot.js.org/apps/?rpc=wss://rpc.vara-network.io#/staking, and you will find a list of the active validators\n\nSlashing is a mechanism to punish validators who act maliciously or negligently. If a validator tries to corrupt the network or is offline too often, a part of their staked fund (and those of their nominators) can be slashed.\n\nYour validator node can be slashed under the following scenarios:\n\nEquivocation: This occurs when a validator signs two or more blocks at the same height on the same chain. It's a serious offense because it can lead to the creation of two different versions of the blockchain, a situation known as a fork.\n\nUnresponsiveness: Validators are expected to be online and participate in the network consensus. If a validator is offline for an extended period and misses a certain number of votes, a portion of their stake can be slashed. This is generally considered a minor offense, and the slashing is less severe than for equivocation or producing invalid blocks.\n\nInvalid Block: Validators are expected to validate blocks correctly. If a validator produces a block that the network deems invalid, it can result in slashing. Note that it's unlikely to produce an invalid block unless you are running a modified node binary, therefore it's recommended to always download the binary from the official release page.\n\nIf a single validator is offline there’s no obvious reason to suspect malicious intent. The validator is not slashed, which means they also keep all their nominations. They are chilled. In practice, the protocol considers it problematic when 10% of the validator set is offline—that’s when slashing conditions kick in.\n\nThe penalty starts relatively small, 0.021% slashed if 10% are offline. But penalties increase linearly from there until the maximum penalty of 7% is hit when 44% of the network is offline.\n\nValidators may run their nodes on multiple machines to make sure they can still perform validation work in case one of their nodes goes down, but validator operators should be extremely careful in setting these up. If they do not have good coordination to manage signing machines, equivocation is possible, and equivocation offenses are slashed at much higher rates than equivalent offline offenses.\n\nGRANDPA equivocation has the harshest slashing penalty of all offenses, and it also exemplifies slashing based on the threat to the network—if 33% or more of the validator set commits a GRANDPA equivocation, the offenders lose 100% of their stake.\n\nIf you wish to remain a validator or nominator (e.g. you're only stopping for planned downtime or server maintenance), submitting the chill extrinsic in the staking pallet should suffice. It is only if you wish to unbond funds or reap an account that you should continue with the following.\n\nTo ensure a smooth stop to validation, make sure you should do the following actions:\n\nThese can all be done with PolkadotJS Apps interface or with extrinsics.\n\nFor each validator only the 256 biggest nominators can claim their reward. If you have more than 256 nominators, it is called oversubscription. Nominators should generally avoid nominating oversubscribed validators.\n\nYes, you can run multiple validators in Vara Network. Each validator will need its own separate stash and controller keys, as well as enough staked fund (either self-staked or nominated by others) to be in the active validator set.\n\nRunning multiple validators can increase your chances of earning rewards, but it also increases your responsibilities and potential risk of slashing. Remember, each validator node requires maintenance, a stable internet connection, and a secure setup to prevent downtime and malicious attacks.\n\nIt's important to note that running multiple validators doesn't mean running multiple nodes on the same server or under the same network conditions. This could lead to simultaneous failures, which could result in multiple nodes being slashed at the same time. Ideally, each validator node should be run on separate servers and potentially in different geographic locations for redundancy and resilience.\n\nTo maintain high availability for your validator node, it may seem tempting to use redundant validator setups. However, incorrect setups can be risky because validator session keys should be confined to one node. Duplication across nodes may cause equivocation slashes, leading to the loss of all staked funds.\n\nFortunately, a validator doesn't require constant uptime, as there's some tolerance within eras for offline periods and upgrades, and the slashing penalties due to downtime are much less severe than that caused by equivocation.\n\nTherefore, only attempt a high availability set-up when you know what you're doing.\n\n* Telemetry This tracks your node details including the version you are running, block height, CPU & memory usage, block propagation time, etc.\n\n* Prometheus-based monitoring stack, including Grafana for dashboards and log aggregation. It includes alerting, querying, visualization, and monitoring features and works for both cloud and on-premise systems.\n\nIdeally, a validator node should strive for 100% uptime to avoid any penalties and to perform its duties on the network effectively. In practice 99.5% uptime is considered safe, i.e. you should keep the daily average downtime within 15 minutes.\n\nNote that the actual amount of staked token (self-stake plus nominations) required to become a validator may be significantly higher due to competition from other validators.\n\nThe total amount of token that needs to be staked for a validator to be elected (self-stake plus nominations) is determined by the amount staked on other validators. If there are more validators who have a higher total stake, those validators will be chosen instead.\n\nYou can get the details by running the subquery/tutorials-validator-threshold indexer on Vara Network.\n\nStaking rewards are distributed at the end of each era, i.e., every 12 hours.\n\nRewards for validators and nominators are computed per era (an era is a period of 12 hours) based on era points. An era point is a reward point earned by a validator for performing certain actions such as producing a block.\n\nThe total reward pool for an era is split between validators (and their nominators) proportionally to the number of era points they have earned. The more era points a validator earns, the larger the portion of the reward pool they (and their nominators) receive.\n\nThe validator's own reward is then calculated based on their commission, which is a percentage of the total reward that they take before distributing the rest to their nominators. Nominators' rewards are distributed based on the amount of fund they have staked.\n\nThe commission is the percentage of rewards you keep before they are given out to nominators. With 0% commission, nominators get all the rewards; with 100% commission, they get NO rewards.\n\nIn general, in order to stay attractive to nominators you should keep the commission low. However, you also need to ensure that the commission rate you set allows you to sustainably operate your validator node. It's a balance of competitive positioning, sustainability, and profitability.\n\nThe ideal number of active validators is defined by the staking.validatorsCount storage item, and is subject to change in the future.\n\nYou can query the storage item by visiting PolkadotJS Apps > Developer > Chain state > staking > validatorCount\n\nIn each era, if there are more validators than the ideal threshold, the inactive validators will stay in the waiting list until they are elected.\n\nIt is recommended to have backups of the following files and directories in case your current node becomes inaccessible due to extreme conditions:\n\nValidator Session Keys: If you are running a validator node, please backup the secret seeds of your session keys for minimal downtime migration. These files are located in the ~/.local/share/gear/chains/vara_network/keystore directory. You must submit an extrinsic to replace the keys if they are leaked or lost.\n\nNetwork Key(optional): The network key uniquely identifies your node in the peer-to-peer network. It is located at ~/.local/share/gear/chains/vara_network/network/secret_ed25519. If this file is lost, a new peer identity will be randomly generated when the node starts.\n\nBlockchain Database(optional): The blockchain database resides in the ~/.local/share/gear/chains/vara_network/db directory. It can be deleted and synchronized from scratch at any time, but keep in mind that this process may take some time."}
