## Project Overview

The aim was to set the base of a voting system that focuses on contribution/merit, and tries to eliminate the possibility of getting voting based on financial potential.  

## Project Details

### Background

In many cases DAOs try to be as simple as it's possible, specially on voting. As it turned out in the past, there are a lot of possible vulnerabilities in these systems, they can not just act as a risk factor in separated decisions, but sometimes can put the whole DAO in danger. In this document we try to outline the possible vulnerabilities and the base of a solution on very high level.

### Possible vulnerabilities

**Centralization Risks:**
   - Concentration of voting power among a small number of participants can lead to centralization. This undermines the decentralized principles of DAOs and may result in decisions that do not represent the broader community. Centralization can be achieved by heaping up merit or any resource that is a basis of the voting power. 

**Governance Attacks:**
   - Malicious actors may attempt to exploit vulnerabilities in the governance mechanisms to manipulate decision-making processes. This includes attacks such as Sybil attacks, 51% attacks, and other governance-related vulnerabilities. It seems to be the most complex set of attacks.

**Badly defined sources of voting power:**
    - In case of DAOs built on a certain chain, simplification effort or economical approach may result deriving voting power from owning currency. This is an obviously exploitable attack vector, by buying voting power a malicious actor can gain voting power, and using that may be able to gain even more voting power.  

**Lack of Participation:**
   - Low voter turnout or lack of engagement from the community can result in decisions that do not reflect the collective will of the DAO members. This can lead to suboptimal outcomes and governance inefficiencies. (Eg: in case of low participation only a few voter can make decisions.)

**Tokenomics Risks:**
   - Flaws in the tokenomics design, such as unfair token distribution, inflation, or deflation can lead to economic imbalances and impact the overall stability and functionality of the DAO.

**Operational Risks:**
    - DAOs may face operational challenges, such as inefficient decision-making processes, communication breakdowns, or difficulties in implementing approved proposals. These risks can hinder the overall effectiveness of the organization.

### A possible solution

## Defining Merit
- Criteria for assessing merit: merits can be earned for supporting the ecosystem. Merits can be represented as tokens, independently from any currency. 
- Merits are the only source of voting power.
- Merits are automatically burned after a certain time.

## Measurement and Evaluation
- At the start of a new voting system, merits are minted between participants.
- A procedure of getting further merits should be defined as (an automatically started) voting.
- Votes are weighted based on merits of the owner.
- Delegated voting should not be supported. (Transfer of merit tokens should also be impossible or has to be approved.)

## Regular Assessments
- Outline the frequency and process for conducting assessments.
- Ensure that the system remains dynamic and reflects ongoing contributions.

## Inclusion
- For a topic involving the whole comunity not merit-based votes could also be initiated.

## Expertise in Specific Domains
- Merits can be assigned to specific domains as a further step.

## Adaptability
- Discuss how the system can adapt to changes in individuals' contributions over time.
- Ensure flexibility for adjustments based on evolving circumstances.

## Avoiding Oligarchy
- In this system oligarchy is only achievable in case when only the supposed-to-be oligarch contributes and earns merits, or the other voters vote against themselves.

## Conclusion
- By taking the step of separation voting power from financial power a more professional and independent DAO becomes available, and opens the way for more features (like specialized merits) aiming the specialization presented in already existing non decentralized organizations, which is a necessary step for growing organizations.
- By introducing time out feature the community stays active.
